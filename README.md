Mission Concept Overview

Mission Statement
Through past and current lunar exploration, it has been found that the Earth’s Moon had
volcanic activity about 3.8 to 3 billion years ago.1 During volcanic eruptions, magma would
reach the surface and, while subjected to the lower surface temperatures, began to harden
into a crust layer. During this process, the magma carried on flowing under the surface,
and tubes were formed. As the eruptions subsided, the magma would eventually exit
the subsurface entirely and leave hollowed lava tubes. Throughout the years the Moon’s
surface experienced impacts from micrometeorites hitting the surface, which created a
number of lunar pits and caves that can allow entry into the lava tubes. Current data
suggests that lunar pits and caves can protect humans and equipment from extreme fluc-
tuations in temperature and radiation, which would allow long-term habitation of humans
for future exploration on the moon.
